# Quantum annealing and information processing of statistical mechanics

The followings are a summary of codes for using quantum annealing.  
These will be published in a textbook of "quantum annealing and information processing of statistical mechanics" on early 2020.  
If you find any problems while checking the following codes, please tell me from issues.
[issues](https://github.com/mohzeki222/quantum_annealing/issues) 

## From a collection Karp NP-complete problems

You can see the following codes through the nbviewer: [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org)  
In addition, you can run the following codes through the Google Colaboratory: [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/)  
  
Please install pyqubo and openjij in your environment or in Google Collaboratory:  
```
pip install pyqubo
pip install openjij
```
pyqubo is a good tool for implementing the Ising model from the form of equation provided by the Recruit Communications Co. Ltd.  
openjij is a labirary for simulating the simulated annealing, quantum annealing and various methods in statistical mechanics provided by the Jij Inc.
